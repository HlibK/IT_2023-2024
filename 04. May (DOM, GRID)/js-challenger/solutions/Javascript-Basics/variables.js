        In this simple exercise we declare a variable called num and assign it a value of 5. Then 
        we try to log the value of the variable using the console.log() method.
        But, the console.log() method contains a small mistake. If you try the run the code, you 
        will see an error message.
        Fix the mistake and run the code again.

        The console.log() statement below attempts to log a variable named num.
        Declare a variable with this name and assign it a number of your choice. Run the code to 
        see if the number is being logged.
